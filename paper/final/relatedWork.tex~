The most closely related work in theory are the aforementioned
algorithms provided by Arora et.al. \cite{} which learn pLSI under
certain assumptions, and the breakthrough by Anand...\cite{} for LSI.
There is a long literature in learning mixtures of distributions in
statistics and more recently in theoretical computer science. See
\cite{MoitraAnkur} for a recent breakthrough on learning mixtures of
Gaussians and a discussion of this field.

To some extent, we seek to provide an infrastructure to evaluate topic
modelling. We should point out that the machine learning community has
been active at producing infrastructure for evaluation.  See for
example, CompML \cite{}. A particularly related java based
infrastructure for topic modelling is \cite{}.  We plan to test their
implementations in the final version of this paper.
