We generated datasets from the LDA model for a range of parameters,
and tested the algorithms discussed in previous section on the
prediction task. For the LDA algorithm and our Projector algorithm, we
also have results for the recovery task. We experimented with $k$ from
$3$ to $30$, and in each case, a set of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to cover
a wide range of $sig\_word$ and $sig\_topic$. See
figure~\ref{fig:predictResult} for the prediction results of the
algorithms on a representative set of datasets.

Also see table~\ref{tab:real} for prediction results on real datasets.  There we see that
LDA is no longer dominated by LSI and Projector.  Still,  nearest neighbor's performance
dominates.  In the appendix, in table~\ref{tab:aptopics} we show the most popular
words in a sampling of topic vectors recovered by Projector in the AP dataset.

Typically, we saw the topic matching to correlate with prediction performance.
See figure~\ref{fig:size-matters} to see this result.
